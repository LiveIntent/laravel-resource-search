# Release

Releases are handled with [Packagist](https://packagist.org) which is the default [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) repository.

## Procedure

- **Create a git tag** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Tags should be prefixed with a `v`.

- **Push the tag** - Once the tag is pushed the package will be automatically released.
